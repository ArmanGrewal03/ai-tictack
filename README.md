## Features

- AI comes in two modes, Level 0 and Level 1.
  - **Level 0**: AI makes random moves.
  - **Level 1**: The AI is unbeatable (will either win or draw).
- Visual indication of a line when three X's or O's align.
- Easy placement of X's and O's by clicking on the squares.
- Implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency.

- To switch between AI levels:
  - Press `0` on the keyboard for Level 0 AI.
  - Press `1` on the keyboard for Level 1 AI (unbeatable).
- To switch to two-player mode (no AI):
  - Press `g` on the keyboard.
- To reset the game and clear all values:
  - Press `r` on the keyboard.
